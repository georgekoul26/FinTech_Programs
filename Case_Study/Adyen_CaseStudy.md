# **Adyen Case Study**

## **Overview and Origin**
Adyen is a payment processing company that was founded in 2006. The Dutch comapny was founded by Pieter van der Does and Arnout Schuijff.  Their idea was to create a network that connects card networks with local payment networks and provides shopper data metrics to merchants.  Their strategy primarily targets medium and large cap companies.  They have recieved 266 million dollars between two funding rounding in 2011 and 2014, and went public in July 2018. 

## **Business Activities**
The globalization of the world's markets and the rise of online shopping has allowed every merchant to sell their products internationally.  This, combined with all of the different ways(online, mobile, retail stores) with which customers can purchase items has complicated the payment proccessing domain.  For example, a merchant must be able to accent mulitpel different forms of currency to allow international consumers to buy their products.  Adyen provides a platform for merchants to process payments through all of the above channels.  One of their major advantages is that they specifically focus on medium and large cap companies.  This is because Ayden uses a more complicated system for fees.  Most payment processors, like Stripe, use a flat fee that covers the different complexities of payment types.  Adyen uses a system that changes the fee based on the complexity of the payment processing. This system is more difficult for ther merchant to understand but is less costly.  This is why Adyen targets larger companies that are able to understand the complexities of the system.  
A major technical advantage for Ayden is that they keep everything in-house.  Things like risk management, security, and their cloud services are all developed at Adyen.  One of their top technologies is their tokenization system.  This system makes payments more secure by replacing sensitive data. This system also allows merchants to securely keep the token for things like subscription services or contactless payments.  This increases the efficieny of payment systems. In December 2020 Microsoft adopted Adyen's tokenization technology. 

## **Landscape**
The landscape of payment processing has changed greatly in the last 5-10 years mainly due to the increasing numbers of different ways to pay.  Major innovations include contactless payments, mobile wallets, crypotcurrencies, and more.  All of these systems have increased the complexity of the payment streams and tested their security.  Other major companies in this space are Paypal, Stripe, and Worldpay. 

## **Results**
Adyen was started much later than two of its main competitors, Paypal and Worldpay, but has grown rapidly in the last five years. Some metrics for growth are numbers of transaction and transaction volume.  Adyen transaction volume is growing at  double the rate of PayPal. Adyen makes about 1% on every dollar spent, compated to 2-3% for its competitors, because of the differences in how they calculate the fees.  However, their fees are smaller and more transparent, giving them a growth advantage going forward.  With this fee structure and by targeting large cap companies, they have aquired clients such as EBay, Netflix, Spotify, and Microsoft.  

## **Recommendations**
My recommendation for Adyen would be to continue to focus on growth with large cap companies.  Although Adyen works with American companies most of their revenue comes from Europe.  They have major growth potential if they are able to expand efficiently into to United States and Asia.  This is a possibility because their fee structure and transparency is very attractive to large companies.  Another option they have is acquisitions.  They have about 2 billion dollars of cash and could look to acquire companies that will improve their technology.  A potential option for expansion would be to expand into the consumer to consumer(C2C) space.  They could use their tokenization system to make C2C payments more secure and efficient.  However, this space is very competitive and consumers have many optiona already, so I think it would be better to continue with their current focus on medium and large cap companies.
